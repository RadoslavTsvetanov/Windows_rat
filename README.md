# What

Windows rat achieving persistence by setting up a win registry key with admin privileges

since ssh or http is quite noisy and needs ports instead it checks for commands on a remote 
url and executes them in order

in addition to being able to send just `.bat` scripts or start a shell and sends commands to it
for easier scripting it also provides support for plugins which support a number of helpful options 
like `start_at_boot`, `run every x amunt of ms` etc..., ofc you can implement them yourself but it makes detection easier.
also it provides runtime utilities like the `secure storage api` which hides data on places harder to be detected by antivirus
